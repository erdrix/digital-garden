But it was quite frustrating because, over time, things would slip out of my mind replaced by other discoveries, not lost forever, but much harder to retrieve and share!\n\nAnd then I read Jacky's [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) page sharing his [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project, it gave me the tool I'd been missing, being able to document, create my garden full of seeds to grow and share with anyone interested üåª.\n\n\n## My garden ü•ï\nI'm just at the beginning of my garden, the land is still uncultivated, and I don't know where I will put the vegetable patch, how I will organize my plots, which trees and flowers I will be able to plant, and how they will grow! So, we will start by drawing inspiration from the neighbors.\n\n### #Seeds\n\nI tend to generally bookmark things for later then revisit them when I have time. For [ideas list](thoughts/bag%20of%20seeds.md), writing, and all sorts of reading. Even when reading books, I don‚Äôt like to take complex notes right away will only bookmark or highlight phrases. I will eventually come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts. It feels like this weeds out unnecessary noise and provides a natural chance for spaced repetition.\n\nThese are the seeds that form the basis of ideas and thoughts.\n\n### #Saplings\n\nSaplings are single nodes or thoughts.\n\n### #Fruits\n\nOf course, a knowledge index isn‚Äôt much use if it doesn‚Äôt inform future thinking and output. Fruits are derivative or ‚Äônew‚Äô pieces of content.\n\nIt‚Äôs the act of creating ‚Äônewer‚Äô work from saplings, mostly longer form #posts, [projects](thoughts/projects.md), etc. At this stage, thoughts and ideas have matured enough to be able to share and collaborate.\n\n\n## Let's take a digital coffee ‚òï\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e Feel free to join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/konpytika/shared_invite/zt-14md072lv-Jr8mqYoeUrqzfZF~YGUpXA) for a chat ü§ó\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-07-26":{"title":"26-07-2023","content":"\n##  Discussion with Pierre\n\n- Redshift serverless -\u003e Will go\n- Data Catalog -\u003e Data Hub innovation day\n- Ansible automation -\u003e [Github Actions](thoughts/github%20actions.md) vs AWX vs AWS SSM\n\n## Log and metric management vector\n\n- ECS discussion: \n\t- Integration Vault \u003e Secret Manager \u003e Environment variable\n\t- Log driver approach: Splunk, Firelens\n- Challenge Vector vs other approaches with Thomas.\n\n## DBT\n\n- Finish docker image for base\n\n## Cost allocation\n\n- Discussion and PR review","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-07-27":{"title":"27-07-2023","content":"\n##  DBT\n- Add ECR for base image\n- Add ECR for DBT DTMS project\n- Deep dive dataform\n- Automate CI for base image\n\n## Cost allocation\n- PRs review\n\n## Meets\n- 121 Josselin\n- Review\n\n## Fast logging\n- Secret integration avec Vault + Secret manager","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-07-28":{"title":"28-07-2023","content":"\n## Data architecture comitee\n### Topics\n- Vector ‚Üí Scoping logging + monitoring\n\n### Decisions\n- ECS integration with Vault via Terraform‚Üí Ok to deal integration that way\n\n### Actions\n- Move from ECS to EKS\n- `Vector.toml` ‚Üí add an entrypoint in the Dockerfile to manage the config via environment variable.\n\n## Data Catalog\n\n\n## DBT\n- Generates .py + manifest.json\n- Issues with CI:\n\t- No explicite message because github action not allowed\n\t- AWS assume role unused.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-07-31":{"title":"31-07-2023","content":"\n‚Üí Setup new mac\n\n## DBT\n\n- Start merge some of the DBT PRs\n- Build image DBT DTMs\n- Support multiple platforms\n\n## CI\n\n- Assume role","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-08-01":{"title":"01-08-2023","content":"\n\n## DBT\n- Sync DBT with Mathieu \u0026 Lucas\n- Github action docker build support multiple platforms\n- ECR terraform module support empty list of readers or writers\n- Move from CI to multiple-stage docker image for python model and manifest.json\n- Scoping source to sensors\n\n## CI\n- Take back ownership on CI image\n- Add buildx to support multi-stage build with redshift connection\n\n## Meets\n- Ops sharing\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-08-02":{"title":"02-08-2023","content":"\n## CI\n- Test new Image on production\n\n## DBT\n- Sync DBT with Business scale:\n\t- TADA for AE on DBT usage (concrete UC with model import etc.)\n\t- Workshop with people by Vincent to evangelize usage\n\t- Work on Airflow integration + Concrete UC to validate\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/daily_log/2023-08-04":{"title":"04-08-2023","content":"\n## \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Apache-NiFi":{"title":"Apache NiFi","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Kubernetes":{"title":"Kubernetes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Kubernetes-CRD":{"title":"Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-18T17:12:01.495674258Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Kubernetes-network-policies":{"title":"Network policies","content":"\n[Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md) Network policies are an application-centric construct which allow you to specify how a pod is allowed to communicate with various network ‚Äúentities‚Äù (endpoints, services) over the network.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: test-network-policy\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  podSelector:\n    matchLabels:\n      role: db\n  policyTypes:\n    -

In this case, the encapsulating is taking place at the hardware level using #aws [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md) inside a [VPC](thoughts/aws%20vpc.md).\n\n![](thoughts/images/pod_networking_amazon_vpc_cni.png)\n\nThe plugin support two modes when it comes to manage IP addresses management for pods:\n\n- [Prefix mode](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/prefix-mode/index_linux/ \"https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/prefix-mode/index_linux/\"): allows [Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md) Pods to have the same IP address as they do on the [VPC](thoughts/aws%20vpc.md) network. More specifically, all containers inside the Pod share a network namespace, and they can communicate with each-other using local ports.\n- [Secondary IP mode](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/vpc-cni/#overview \"https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/vpc-cni/#overview\"): when a worker node is provisioned, it has a default [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md), called the primary [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md), attached to it. The [CNI](thoughts/container%20network%20inteface%20plugin.md) allocates a warm pool of [ENIs](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md) and secondary IP addresses from the subnet attached to the node‚Äôs primary [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md). By default, IPAMD (a long-running node-local IP Address Management daemon and is responsible for) attempts to allocate an additional [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md) to the node. The IPAMD allocates additional [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md) when a single Pod is scheduled and assigned a secondary IP address from the primary [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md). This \"warm\" [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md) enables faster Pod networking. As the pool of secondary IP addresses runs out, the [CNI](thoughts/container%20network%20inteface%20plugin.md) adds another [ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md) to assign more.\n\n## Flow traffic control\nIn #aws a [Security Group (SG)](thoughts/security%20group.md) acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. By default the Amazon [VPC](thoughts/aws%20vpc.md) CNI will use [SGs](thoughts/security%20group.md) associated with the primary[ENI](thoughts/elastic%20network%20interfaces.md)  on the node. Which means that every Pod on a node shares the same security groups as the node it runs on.\n![](thoughts/images/aws_vpc_cni_node_security_group.png)\nWith [Security Group for Pods](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/sgpp/ \"https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/sgpp/\"), multiple types of security rules, such as Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-External AWS services, can be defined in a single place with EC2 security groups and applied to workloads with Kubernetes native APIs.\n\n![](thoughts/images/aws_security_group_for_pods.png)\nTo enable the Security Groups for pod we have to set `ENABLE_POD_ENI = true` for VPC CNI. Once done, for each node in the cluster the add-on adds a label with the value `vpc.amazonaws.com/has-trunk-attached=true`. The [VPC Resource Controller](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-resource-controller-k8s \"https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-resource-controller-k8s\") running on the control plane creates and attaches a trunk interface called ‚Äúaws-k8s-trunk-eni‚Äù to the node. It acts as a standard network interface attached to the instance.\n\nThe controller also creates branch interfaces named \"aws-k8s-branch-eni\" and associates them with the trunk interface. Pods are assigned a security group using the [SecurityGroupPolicy](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-resource-controller-k8s/blob/master/config/crd/bases/vpcresources.k8s.aws_securitygrouppolicies.yaml \"https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-resource-controller-k8s/blob/master/config/crd/bases/vpcresources.k8s.aws_securitygrouppolicies.yaml\") custom resource and are associated with a branch interface. Since security groups are specified with network interfaces, we are now able to [schedule Pods requiring specific security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-groups-for-pods.html#sg-pods-example-deployment \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/security-groups-for-pods.html#sg-pods-example-deployment\") on these additional network interfaces.\n\n![](thoughts/images/aws_security_group_for_pods_branch_eni.png)\n\n\u003e [!warning] \n\u003e Branch interface capacity is _additive_ to existing instance type limits for secondary IP addresses. Pods that use security groups are not accounted for in the max-pods formula and when you use security group for pods you need to consider [raising the max-pods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-increase-ip-addresses.html \"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-increase-ip-addresses.html\") value or be ok with running fewer pods than the node can actually support.\n\n#### Recommandation\n\nSome highlights on recommandations using this feature:\n\n\u003e[!info]   [Disable TCP Early Demux for Liveness Probe](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/sgpp/#disable-tcp-early-demux-for-liveness-probe \"https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/sgpp/#disable-tcp-early-demux-for-liveness-probe\")\n\u003e\n\u003eIf are you using liveness or readiness probes, you also need to disable TCP early demux, so that the kubelet can connect to Pods on branch network interfaces via TCP\n\n\u003e [!info] [Supporting Kubernetes Network Policy](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/sgpp/#enforcing-mode-use-standard-mode-in-the-following-situations \"https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/networking/sgpp/#enforcing-mode-use-standard-mode-in-the-following-situations\")\n\u003e \n\u003e We recommend using standard enforcing mode when using network policy with Pods that have associated security groups.\n\u003e\n\u003eWe strongly recommend to utilize security groups for Pods to limit network-level access to AWS services that are not part of a cluster.

At the foundation of Cilium is a new Linux kernel technology called [eBPF](thoughts/eBPF.md), which enabled the dynamic insertion of powerful security, visibility, and networking control logic into the Linux kernel.\n\n## Global architecture\n![](thoughts/images/cilium_global_architecture.png)\n\n### Cilium\n- **Agent:** runs on each node in the cluster. It accepts configuration via [Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md) or APIs that describes networking, service load-balancing, [Kubernetes network policies](thoughts/Kubernetes%20network%20policies.md), and visibility \u0026 monitoring requirements. It listens for events from orchestration systems such as [Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md) to learn when containers or workloads are started and stopped. It manages the [eBPF](thoughts/eBPF.md) programs which the Linux kernel uses to control all network access in / out of those containers.\n- **Operator:** is responsible for managing duties in the cluster which should logically be handled once for the entire cluster, rather than once for each node in the cluster. The Cilium [kubernetes operator](thoughts/kubernetes%20operator.md) is not in the critical path for any forwarding or network policy decision.\n- **[CNI plugin](thoughts/container%20network%20inteface%20plugin.md):** is invoked by Kubernetes when a pod is scheduled or terminated on a node. It interacts with the Cilium API of the node to trigger the necessary datapath configuration to provide networking, load-balancing and [Kubernetes network policies](thoughts/Kubernetes%20network%20policies.md) for the pod.\n\n### Data Store\nCilium requires a data store to propagate state between agents. It supports the following data stores:\n\n- **Kubernetes CRDs (Default):** The default choice to store any data and propagate state is to use [Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](thoughts/Kubernetes%20CRD.md). CRDs are offered by  [Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md) for cluster components to represent configurations and state via  [Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md) resources.\n- **Key-Value Store** **(etcd):** A key-value store can optionally be used as an optimization to improve the scalability of a cluster as change notifications and storage requirements are more efficient with direct key-value store usage\n\n### Observability with Hubble\n- **Server:** runs on each node and retrieves the eBPF-based visibility from Cilium. It is embedded into the Cilium agent in order to achieve high performance and low-overhead. It offers a gRPC service to retrieve flows and Prometheus metrics.\n- **Relay:** standalone component which is aware of all running Hubble servers and offers cluster-wide visibility by connecting to their respective gRPC APIs and providing an API that represents all servers in the cluster.\n- **Graphical UI:** utilizes relay-based visibility to provide a graphical service dependency and connectivity map.\n\n## eBPF datapath: Linux Kernel\n[eBPF](thoughts/eBPF.md) is used to provide high-performance networking, multi-cluster and multi-cloud capabilities, advanced load balancing, transparent encryption, extensive network security capabilities, transparent observability, and much more.\n\nHere is an example how the life of a packet, with [eBPF](thoughts/eBPF.md).\n\n![](thoughts/images/cilium_ebpf_packer_life.png)\n- **Network endpoint (lxc)**: Defines in Kubernetes as [Cilium Endpoint](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/ciliumendpoint/ \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/kubernetes/ciliumendpoint/\") CR. It defines the network interface couple (one in the pod, another one on the host) that link the pod network to the host network.\n\u003e [!note] \n\u003e\n\u003e Even if an endpoint is running, it doesn't mean it's ready. [Here](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/lifecycle/ \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/lifecycle/\") is the graph states and their meanings.\n- **Barckley Packet Filter BPF**: a technology used in certain computer operating systems for programs that need to, among other things, analyze network traffic. It provides a raw interface to data link layers, permitting raw link-layer packets to be sent and received.\n\u003e [!note] \n\u003e \n\u003e I highly recommend anyone working with Cilium to watch this video: [Episode 51: Life of a Packet with Cilium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BKU6avwS98\u0026t=494s). It explains the basics of this scheme, and gives the commands and methodology for gaining visibility of the network flow, which is very useful for debugging.\n\n## Flow traffic control\nThe configuration of the Cilium agent and the Cilium [network policy](thoughts/Kubernetes%20network%20policies.md) determines whether an endpoint accepts traffic from a source or not. The agent can be put into the following three policy enforcement modes:\n- **default:** endpoints will start without any restrictions and as soon as a rule restricts their ability to receive traffic on ingress or to transmit traffic on egress, then the endpoint goes into whitelisting mode and all traffic must be explicitly allowed.\n- **always:** policy enforcement is enabled on all endpoints even if no rules select specific endpoints.\n- **never:** policy enforcement is disabled on all endpoints, even if rules do select specific endpoints.\n\n### Layer 3 policy\nCan be specified using the following methods:\n- [Labels Based](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#labels-based \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#labels-based\"): used to describe the relationship if both endpoints are managed by Cilium and are thus assigned labels.\n- [Services based](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#services-based \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#services-based\"): Intermediate form between Labels and CIDR and makes use of the services concept in the orchestration system.\n- [Entities Based](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#entities-based \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#entities-based\"): Entities are used to describe remote peers which can be categorized without knowing their IP addresses.\n- [IP/CIDR based](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#cidr-based \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#cidr-based\"): used to describe the relationship to or from external services if the remote peer is not an endpoint.\n- [DNS based](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#dns-based \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#dns-based\"): Selects remote, non-cluster, peers using DNS names converted to IPs via DNS lookups. It shares all limitations of the [IP/CIDR based](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#cidr-based \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#cidr-based\") rules above. DNS information is acquired by routing DNS traffic via a proxy, or polling for listed DNS targets. DNS TTLs are respected.\n\n### Layer 4 policy\nLayer 4 policy can be specified in addition to layer 3 policies or independently. It restricts the ability of an endpoint to emit and/or receive packets on a particular port using a particular protocol.\n\n### Layer 7 policy\nLayer 7 policy rules are embedded into Layer 4 rules and can be specified for ingress and egress.\n- **path:** extended POSIX regex matched against the path of a request\n- **method:** extended POSIX regex matched against the method of a request, e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, ‚Ä¶\n- **host:** extended POSIX regex matched against the host header of a request, e.g. `foo.com`\n- **headers:** list of HTTP headers which must be present in the request\n\n\u003e [!warning]  \n\u003e \n\u003e DNS Proxy intercepts egress DNS traffic and records IPs seen in the responses. This interception is, itself, a [separate policy rule governing the DNS requests](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#dns-proxy \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#dns-proxy\"), and must be specified separately\n\n\u003e [!note]\n\u003e \n\u003e Unlike layer 3 and layer 4 policies, violation of layer 7 rules does not result in packet drops. Instead, if possible, an application protocol specific access denied message is crafted and returned, e.g. an _HTTP 403 access denied_ is sent back for HTTP requests which violate the policy, or a _DNS REFUSED_ response for DNS requests.\n\n\u003e [!note]\n\u003e \n\u003e Layer 7 rules are not currently supported in [Host Policies](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#hostpolicies \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#hostpolicies\"), i.e., policies that use [Node Selector](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/intro/#nodeselector \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/intro/#nodeselector\").\n\n### Egress gateway\n\n[Egress Gateway ‚Äî Cilium 1.14.0 documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/egress-gateway/\n\nEgress gateway feature routes all IPv4 connections originating from pods and destined to specific cluster-external CIDRs through particular nodes, from now on called ‚Äúgateway nodes‚Äù. When enabled, matching packets that leave the cluster are masqueraded with selected, predictable IPs associated with the gateway nodes.\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e As an example, this feature can be used in combination with legacy firewalls to allow traffic to legacy infrastructure only from specific pods within a given namespace. The pods typically have ever-changing IP addresses, and even if masquerading was to be used as a way to mitigate this, the IP addresses of nodes can also change frequently over time.\n\n## Installation concerns\n\nThere is two installation modes for Cilium:\n\n- [Using the CLI](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/k8s-install-default/ \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/k8s-install-default/\")\n- [Using an helm chart](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/installation/k8s-install-helm/ \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/installation/k8s-install-helm/\")\n\nFor both configurations, the steps are as follows:\n- Patch managed node groups taints\n- Install cilium with helm chart\n- Restart unmanaged pods\n- Validate installation\n\nSome steps, such as patching the [aws vpc cni](thoughts/aws%20vpc%20cni.md), are not explicit in the CLI documentation and may be hidden, so we need to compare the two implementations to see if any differences exist and what they imply. Same for [ENI integration as a requirement or not](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/concepts/routing/#aws-eni \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/concepts/routing/#aws-eni\").\n\nFor the Helm chart, this means that some steps are manual. We can check out a way to manage our own Helm chart that includes Cilium's and add a Job to perform these steps.\n\nFor the observability part with Hubble, this is the same as for Cilium, we can install with the [CLI or an Helm chart](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble_setup/ \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble_setup/\"), with some configuration:\n- [TLS certificates](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble-configuration/#tls-certificates \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble-configuration/#tls-certificates\") (with [cert-manager](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble-configuration/#auto-generated-certificates-via-cert-manager \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble-configuration/#auto-generated-certificates-via-cert-manager\")? or [auto-generated via Helm](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble-configuration/#auto-generated-certificates-via-helm \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble-configuration/#auto-generated-certificates-via-helm\"))\n- [Enable UI](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble/#enable-the-hubble-ui \"https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble/#enable-the-hubble-ui\")\n\n### Specific Configurations\n#### Tunnel mode\n- **Overlay:** Encapsulation-based virtual network spanning all hosts.
