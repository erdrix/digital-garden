But it was quite frustrating because, over time, things would slip out of my mind replaced by other discoveries, not lost forever, but much harder to retrieve and share!\n\nAnd then I read Jacky's [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) page sharing his [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project, it gave me the tool I'd been missing, being able to document, create my garden full of seeds to grow and share with anyone interested ðŸŒ».\n\n\n## My garden ðŸ¥•\nI'm just at the beginning of my garden, the land is still uncultivated, and I don't know where I will put the vegetable patch, how I will organize my plots, which trees and flowers I will be able to plant, and how they will grow! So, we will start by drawing inspiration from the neighbors.\n\n### #Seeds\n\nI tend to generally bookmark things for later then revisit them when I have time. For [ideas list](thoughts/bag%20of%20seeds.md), writing, and all sorts of reading. Even when reading books, I donâ€™t like to take complex notes right away will only bookmark or highlight phrases. I will eventually come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts. It feels like this weeds out unnecessary noise and provides a natural chance for spaced repetition.\n\nThese are the seeds that form the basis of ideas and thoughts.\n\n### #Saplings\n\nSaplings are single nodes or thoughts.\n\n### #Fruits\n\nOf course, a knowledge index isnâ€™t much use if it doesnâ€™t inform future thinking and output. Fruits are derivative or â€™newâ€™ pieces of content.\n\nItâ€™s the act of creating â€™newerâ€™ work from saplings, mostly longer form #posts, [projects](thoughts/projects.md), etc. At this stage, thoughts and ideas have matured enough to be able to share and collaborate.\n\n\n## Let's take a digital coffee â˜•\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e Feel free to join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/konpytika/shared_invite/zt-14md072lv-Jr8mqYoeUrqzfZF~YGUpXA) for a chat ðŸ¤—\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/code/.gitkeep":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/meets/.gitkeep":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/scoping/.gitkeep":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/private/doctolib/term/.gitkeep":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Apache-NiFi":{"title":"Apache NiFi","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Kubernetes":{"title":"Kubernetes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/NiFiKop":{"title":"NiFiKop","content":"\nIt is is an open-source [Kubernetes operator](thoughts/kubernetes%20operator.md) that makes itÂ easyÂ to run [Apache NiFi](thoughts/Apache%20NiFi.md) on [Kubernetes](thoughts/Kubernetes.md).","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/bag-of-seeds":{"title":"Bag of seeds ðŸŒ±","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/github-actions":{"title":"Github Actions","content":"[how to access private repositories from GA](thoughts/how%20to%20access%20private%20repositories%20from%20GA.md)","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/how-to-access-private-repositories-from-GA":{"title":"How to access private repositories from Github Actions?","content":"\nWhen running in [Github Actions](thoughts/github%20actions.md), the private repositories can not be accessed since the runners is not configured to access the private repositories.\n\n## The solution\n\nSince the private repositories that my app depending on are mine as well, therefore I can add the required configuration into those private repositories with the action [ssh-agent](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent)\n\nThe following steps are required to setup the SSH keys for the runner during runtime to access the private repositories:\n\n- Create SSH key for the private repositories by runningÂ  `ssh-keygen -C \"git@github.com:erdrix/digital-garden-git.git\"`Â .\n- Put the public key as deployment key into the private repository.\n- Put the private key as a secret into the main repository.\n- Change your action a bit\n\n```yaml\n# Make sure the @v0.7.0 matches the current version of the action\n- uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.7.0\n  with:\n    ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT }}\n\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  with:\n    submodules: recursive # this is important not to forget\n```\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/kubernetes-operator":{"title":"Kubernetes Operator","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/projects":{"title":"Projects","content":"\n# NiFiKop - A Kubernetes operator for Apache NiFi\n[NiFiKop](thoughts/NiFiKop.md), is an open-source Kubernetes operator that makes itÂ easyÂ to run Apache NiFi on Kubernetes. \n\n[Github](https://github.com/konpyutaika/nifikop), [Documentation](https://konpyutaika.github.io/nifikop/)","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T22:18:48.815545773Z","tags":null}}
